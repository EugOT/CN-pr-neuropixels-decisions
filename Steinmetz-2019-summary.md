In this study, Neuropixel probes were used to record the activity of approximately 30,000 neurons across 42 brain regions in mice performing a visual discrimination task. The mice earned water rewards by turning a wheel to indicate which of two visual gratings had higher contrast or by not turning if no stimulus was presented.

Electrical potentials were measured by hundreds of electrodes along the length of each probe.
Each electrode's measurements captured local variations in the electric field due to nearby spiking neurons. A spike sorting algorithm was used to infer spike times and cluster spikes according to common origin: a single cluster of sorted spikes is causally attributed to a single neuron.

The recordings revealed how neurons in different regions are involved in making visual choices. They found that neural signals related to movements, rewards, and other task variables are present in multiple brain regions, even in areas previously thought to be purely sensory.

By examining the activity of individual neurons across trials, Steinmetz et al. (2019) identified consistent patterns related to action initiation, sensory stimuli, or choices. While responses to visual stimuli are mostly confined to specific visual pathways, action-related signals are widespread across the brain. For a brain region to carry choice-related signals, it must have neurons which activity predict the chosen action before it happens.

Steinmetz et al. (2019) focused on pre-movement activity to predict upcoming movements. It was found possible to predict whether a mouse would respond to a stimulus based on the 'engagement index,' which reflects the difference in pre-stimulus activity between passive and task contexts.

Neurons that encode actions are widely distributed, while those that encode choices are rarer and less widely distributed. Choice-encoding neurons show unilateral encoding in the midbrain and bilateral encoding in the forebrain.

Summary of findings:

• Visual activity pathways are localized.

• Action-related signals are global.

• Choice-encoding neurons are rarer and less widely distributed than action-encoding neurons.

• Pre-stimulus activity can predict a mouse's response to a stimulus.

Future work will be required to determine the circuit mechanisms that enforce these principles, how they extend to areas such as cerebellum and brainstem omitted from the current survey, and the degree to which similar principles govern the neural correlates of different choice tasks.
