Mechanism of Action Potential Generation (Steinmeltz et al., 2019)

Excitation and inhibition govern neural dynamics.
Excitatory inputs from areas processing visual stimuli (e.g., visual cortex, thalamus) depolarize neurons by 
activating glutamate-mediated ion channels (e.g., AMPA and NMDA), hence enhancing the probability of action 
potentials.
Inhibitory inputs, especially from GABAergic neurons in subcortical areas, modulate spiking by hyperpolarizing 
the membrane and diminishing activity in situations where spiking would be detrimental.

This interaction guarantees accurate coding, as seen in the paper's findings where neurons processing visual 
stimuli exhibit selective firing in sensory regions.

Action-related spiking is indiscriminate and disseminated across the brain.

Choice-related spiking is localized and associated with task-relevant factors.

Significance of Spiking Mechanisms 

The spiking mechanism corresponds with the organizational principles defined in the paper (Steinmeltz et al., 
2019): 
Excitation and inhibition influence the spatial and temporal dynamics of neuronal spiking. 
The widespread spiking dynamics facilitate the synthesis of sensory inputs, decision-making, and behavioral 
involvement throughout several brain regions. 
Neuropixels recordings elucidate the organization of spiking patterns, emphasizing the brain's capacity to 
encode intricate activities via the interaction of localized and distant networks.
