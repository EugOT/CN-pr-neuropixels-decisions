The study employs Neuropixels probes to investigate neural activity throughout the mouse brain during a visual discriminating test. Neuronal spiking (action potentials) is the essential mechanism facilitating the distributed encoding of vision, decision-making, action, and engagement shown in this work. 
Neuronal Firing in Distributed Networks
Neurons exhibit spiking due to excitation and inhibition, which facilitate transitions between resting and active states. This spiking activity underlies the brain-wide neural correlates identified in:

Vision: Localized spiking in traditional sensory pathways, including the visual cortex and superficial superior colliculus (SCs).

Action: Global spiking activity before to movement, detected in almost all documented brain areas.

Selection: Distinct spiking patterns in confined areas, such as the frontal cortex, basal ganglia, and midbrain, representing lateralized judgments.
