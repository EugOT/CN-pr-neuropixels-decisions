Question: What can ISI tell us?

Phenomenon: Inter Spike Intervals (ISI): the time duration between consecutive spikes (or action potentials) of a neuron

The length of ISI can inform us about neuronal behavior and connectivity. 

In the study, ISIs were analyzed from a large population of recorded neurons across various brain regions while the mice performed a visual task.

The data captured variability in ISIs among different neurons >  some exhibited short ISIs (indicating rapid firing and high excitability) whereas  others showed longer ISIs (suggesting reduced activity/ a refractory phase). 

Methods such as z-scoring were employed to quantify the significance of firing rates. 

The analysis of ISIs contributed to understanding of choice-encoding neurons, with variations in firing patterns correlating with decision-making processes during the visual task. 

Overall, the data on ISIs provide insights into neuronal behavior, highlighting how firing patterns contribute to coding choices and processing information within the brain during task performance.
